Abstract:
Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive
neuromodulation approach that has been reported to perturb task activity and to benefit
patients with a variety of diseases. Nevertheless, the effects of tDCS on brain dynamics
and transitions in brain patterns across states of consciousness remain poorly
understood.
Objective: Here, we investigated the modulatory effect of prefrontal cortex (PFC) tDCS
on brain dynamics, both in the awake state and during anesthesia-induced loss of
consciousness in non-human primates.
Methods: We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data before,
during, and after the application of high-density tDCS (HD-tDCS) utilizing a prefrontaloccipital montage with two electrodes. In the awake state, macaques received either
anodal or cathodal PFC stimulation. Under anesthesia, macaques underwent two
consecutive anodal PFC stimulations of increasing intensity. Dynamical functional
connectivity was measured using fMRI, and the resulting connectivity matrices were
clustered into distinct 'brain patterns'.
Results: We found that cathodal PFC HD-tDCS robustly disrupted the rich dynamic
repertoire of brain patterns of the awake state. It increased the brain structure-function
correlation, decreased Shannon entropy, and strongly favored Markov chain transition
probabilities towards patterns closest to anatomy. Under anesthesia, 2 mA anodal PFC
HD-tDCS significantly changed the distribution of brain patterns and reduced the
structure-function correlation.
Conclusion: Our findings offer compelling evidence that prefrontal tDCS induces a
striking modification in the fMRI-based dynamic organization of the brain across varying
states of consciousness. This contributes to an enhanced understanding of the neural
mechanisms underlying tDCS neuromodulation.
