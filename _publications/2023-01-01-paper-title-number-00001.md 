Abstract:
A central challenge of neuroscience is to elucidate how the orchestration of brain function is
modulated by different states of consciousness. Here, we investigate the link between
distributed structural and functional brain organisation in functional MRI signals of non-human
primates, through bi-directional causal manipulations of consciousness. During varying levels
of propofol, sevoflurane, or ketamine anaesthesia, and subsequent restoration of
responsiveness by deep brain stimulation of the central thalamus, we investigate how loss of
consciousness impacts distributed patterns of structure-function organisation across scales.
Combining the specificity of electrical stimulation with global fMRI coverage of the entire
cortex, we report that distributed brain activity under anaesthesia is increasingly constrained
by brain structure across scales, coinciding with anaesthetic-induced collapse of multiple
dimensions of hierarchical cortical organisation. Crucially, we show that these distributed
signatures of anaesthetic-induced loss of consciousness are observed across different
anaesthetics, and they are reversed by electrical stimulation of the central thalamus,
coinciding with recovery of behavioural markers of consciousness during propofol
anaesthesia. No such effects were observed upon stimulation of a control anatomical site,
ventral lateral thalamus, demonstrating specificity. Through causal manipulations of
consciousness that integrate pharmacology and electrical intracranial stimulation of the
thalamus, our results identify global signatures of consciousness that are under local causal
control by specific nuclei of the thalamus. Overall, the present work broadens our
understanding of the link between brain network organisation and distributed function in
supporting consciousness, and the interplay between local and global functional architecture.
