Abstract:
Assessing the impact of pharmaceutical compounds on brain activity is a critical issue in contemporary neuroscience. Currently, no systematic approach exists for evaluating these effects in whole-brain models, which typically focus on macroscopic phenomena, while pharmaceutical interventions operate at the molecular scale. Here we address this issue by presenting a computational approach for brain simulations using biophysically grounded mean-field models that integrate membrane conductances and synaptic receptors, showcased in the example of anesthesia. We show that anesthetics targeting GABAA and NMDA receptors can switch brain activity to generalized slow-wave patterns, as observed experimentally in deep anesthesia. To validate our models, we demonstrate that these slow-wave states exhibit reduced responsiveness to external stimuli and functional connectivity constrained by anatomical connectivity, mirroring experimental findings in anesthetized states across species. Our approach, founded on mean-field models that incorporate molecular realism, provides a robust framework for understanding how molecular-level drug actions impact whole-brain dynamics.
