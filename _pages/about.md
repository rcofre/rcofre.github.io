I am a scientist at the Inria Centre at Université Côte d'Azur, specializing in neuroscience and the mathematical modeling of the brain. My research explores the intricate mechanisms that shape cognition and behavior, seeking to unravel how neural networks give rise to consciousness.

I have worked on numerous projects developing mathematical models that capture the dynamic interactions between neurons and large-scale brain networks in both patients and healthy volunteers across states such as general anesthesia, sleep, disorders of consciousness, and psychedelic experiences. By bridging theory and experimentation, my work aims to elucidate the fundamental principles underlying brain function, emergent collective dynamics, and consciousness.
