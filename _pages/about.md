I'm a scientist interested in the fields of neuroscience and mathematical modeling of the brain. I have been always  fascinated by the intricacies of the human brain and how it gives rise to our consciousness, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

I've worked on numerous research projects focused on developing mathematical models that can help explain the complex interactions between brain cells and networks, and understanding how collective behaviors emerge from interactions among many neurons.
